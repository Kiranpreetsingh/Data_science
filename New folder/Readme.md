# Machine Learning-based Prediction of COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Symptoms
  ![task-0000001855-8a2918fe](https://github.com/Kiranpreetsingh/Data_science/assets/55728235/cea63795-74f7-4ffb-b6a3-c5e7eba02e0d)

**Overview**
A speedy and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for effective management and containment of the virus. Machine learning models have been developed to predict COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions and allocate resources efficiently. This project aims to build such a predictive model using a dataset downloaded from the 'ABC' government website**.
