# Machine Learning-based Prediction of COVID-19 Diagnosis Based on Symptoms
Overview
A speedy and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for effective management and containment of the virus. Machine learning models have been developed to predict COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions and allocate resources efficiently. This project aims to build such a predictive model using a dataset downloaded from the 'ABC' government website.

Dataset
Source: 'ABC' government website
Total Individuals: 2,78,848
Date Range: 11th March 2020 to 30th April 2020
Columns: 11 (including 8 features suspected to play a role in COVID-19 prediction)
Outcome Variable: COVID test result (positive or negative)
Data Split
Training and Validation Set: 11th March to 15th April 2020
Test Set: 16th April to 30th April 2020
Training-Validation Split Ratio: 4:1
Repository Structure
data: Contains the dataset downloaded from the 'ABC' government website.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
src: Source code for the machine learning model.
README.md: Description of the project, dataset, data split, and repository structure.
Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd machine-learning-covid-prediction
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the data and notebooks in the notebooks directory.
Run the source code in the src directory to train and evaluate the model.
